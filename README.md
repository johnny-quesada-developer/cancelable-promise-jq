## Notice: This library has been renamed!

**Important:** This library was renamed to `easy-cancelable-promise` as of Sep-27-2024.

The package is set up to automatically receive all non-breaking updates from the new library. However, if you're using **easy-web-workers** or **easy-thread-workers**, I kindly ask that you uninstall **cancelable-promise-jq** and switch to **easy-cancelable-promise** to stay up to date. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this small change may cause and truly appreciate your understanding and patience during this transition.

If you're interested in helping make the easy packages even more intuitive or improving them further, I’d love to hear from you! Please don’t hesitate to reach out through my public social media channels—your feedback and contributions are always welcome.

- The new package can now be found at [easy-cancelable-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/easy-cancelable-promise).
